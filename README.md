<h2>Introduction</h2>

> The dataset used for this project is a single-table, flat model, consisting of 1470 rows, divided in more than 40 columns (categories). The rows represent various employees. All the informations gathered by HR department where spread over 41 columns mentioned earlier, that represent many, intresting and helpful variables, from a analytical point of view.
For this dashboard the attrition data were the focal point, but it’s worth  mentioning that other, intresting data can be found here. Relationship status, relathionship satisfaction, distance from work place or monthly income – just to menton few.


<h2>Data Cleaning and Transformation</h2><br>

<b>This dataset was processed to obtain usable information by:</b><br>
>Removing rows consisting of empty values to acquire high-quality output,<br>
Creating additional, conditional columns, necessary for further data modeling,<br>
Removing redundant columns, to not negativly affect performance.

<h2>Problem statement</h2>

<b>The goal of this analysis is to:</b><br>
>Determine the attrition rate in context off all employees,<br>

Know the diffrence between each department,<br>
Compare the data based on various factors, linked to the attrition,<br>
Indicate the key values, to help HR department determine the best hiring policies<br>

<h2>Skills and Concepts demonstrated</h2>

<b>I used PowerBI functions/concepts like:</b>
>Creating key performance indicators (KPIs),<br>

Data Modelling,<br>
Measures, based on added in PowerQuery conditional columns,<br>
Filters,<br>
Data Visualization<br>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>

<b>For this particular dataset the desired KPI were simple to create, since other data, used for the modeling, were more significant.</b><br>
As shown in previous screenshots of this dashboard the causes for attrition can vary. It may depand on education field, job satisfaction, degree or even gender. 
Even thought the basic dataset used for this report had many other factors included I decided to focus on the ones, visualized here. Yet this does not mean other factor are inferior - it simply shows that it's vital for the employers to take care for their staff in more than just one field.
