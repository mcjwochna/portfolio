HR - attiration statistics

Here you can see an example of a dashboard I've created. Feel free to download the .pbix file and test it for yourself.

This particular dataset included many interesting, from a statistical and analytical point of view, metrics like monthly income or number of companies worked for or even martial status or relationship satisfaction.
For the given dashboard however the statistics regarding attiration seemed both interesting to analyze and fun to vizualize.


Before working with the actual data visuals and measures however, dataset itself required a few steps made in Power Query (in this instanced adding additional conditional columns)

I hope this dashboard looks interesting and fun to look at ;)
